           RESEARCH FINDINGS:
•	Through my analysis, it is discovered that crashes and fatalities rate have reduced over the decades which I believe is due to 
                  I)Improved aviation safety and protocols
                   ii)Improved technology
                   iii)Improved and strict aircraft regulations. 
•	The research also shows that crashes which occurred in the air are more fatal that crashes which occurred on the ground.
•	Weather conditions and poor visibility have also been major causes of aircraft crashes and fatalities as seen in the research where we have more crashes in some seasons than others. 
•	The research also shows that in the recent age/time we have more people on aboard than in 1990’s due to reduction rate in plane crashes.
•	Aircraft crashes in certain locations or country/ regions might be as o certain challenging terrains like mountains, deserts, frozen coastlines etc. so such countries or location may have more crashes than other as seen in the research where Russia comes with more crashes because it has this challenging terrains.

                   RECOMMENDATIONS :
•	Aircraft manufactures should ensure that their aircraft are equipped with better navigation and communication tools for challenging environment.
•	Aircrafts older than 30 years should have strict maintenance schedules or replacement due to higher risk of crashing.
•	Operators should be encouraged to use predictive maintenance based on flight and sensor data.
•	Countries and operators should maintain transparent and standardized incident reporting system to foster global safety learning.
